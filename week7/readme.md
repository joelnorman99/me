TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Pip install RISE

Okay, so I have finally reached the point of me enjoying this project YEWWW BOYO.
Ive taken study breaks and gone to do the project. I find it peaceful up until my code doesn't work.
Then I want to snap my laptop hehehe.

ANYWAY PROGRESS UPDATE:

Got Ben to help me with my QLD map. Unfortunately I have an assignment so I couldn't explore this project any further. Will
have to wait till next week.
