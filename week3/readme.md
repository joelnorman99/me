TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Defs stumbled on EX3, needed help due to dumb errors e.g. writing words that weren't defined etc.
the code was repeating at the first step! NOW FIXED

not_number_rejector kept failing in ex3 due to not writing 'message' in print (this was in def function)
however, this was passing in ex1! WAS CONFUSED

https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp ----> very handy website with easy definitions of words, functions and instructions on how to do things

binary search -> halves the limits each time a guess is taken to get closer to an actual number

example of while statement

i = 1
while i < 6:
print(i)
i += 1
else:
print("i is no longer less than 6")

'break' stop a while loop - Needed this when python input an infinite list of 100
