TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

HELLLOOO AND WELCOME

It's Sunday night and I'm excited to say that I've finished (I think)

TBH I am happy with my project, it's definitely something I didn't think I could do. Although
it's very basic compared to other classmate's projects, I'm proud of it. I now want a pet koala.

Capalaba sounds like a horrible place to be for a koala ://///

I need to create a slideshow and edit the colour scheme of my project. Hopefully I won't be indecisive
like I am with everything in life.

It's be a rollercoaster of a term and I'm keen for it to be done.
