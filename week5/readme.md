TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Exercise 1 is annoying and won't work hehe
about to throw my laptop through my window :)))

python ../course/new_exercise_getter.py

python3 ../course/week5/tests.py

UPDATE: Had to copy and paste the original code since my tests weren't passing (errors in exercise code)

perimeter = ((height _ height) + (base _ base)) \*\* (1 / 2) + base + height
return perimeter
